The Application
========================================================
type: sub-section

**Weather Data Explorer** is a shiny web application which based on 
the weather data from China in *2015-01-13* one day. 

This application will allows the user to:

- Choose a province in China, and select a time range within one day. 
- Display the province location in a map from China
- Shows the weather condition like tempreture or wind level of the capital city of that province

Example Code
========================================================
type: sub-section
id: slide3

This is a example code for plot Wind level and Wind direction in *Beijing* from *07:00* to *19:00*, 2015-01-13

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
dat <- read.csv("data.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = time, y = WSE)) +
      geom_line(size = 1) + 
      geom_segment(data 
      = dat, size = 2, aes(x = time, xend = 
      x.end, y = WSE, yend = y.end, color = 
      tempreture), arrow = arrow(length = 
      unit(0.5, "cm"))) + 
      scale_colour_gradient(low="blue", 
      high="red") + coord_cartesian(ylim = 
      c(-1, 6)) + theme_set(theme_bw()) + 
      labs(x = "time", y = "Wind")
```
